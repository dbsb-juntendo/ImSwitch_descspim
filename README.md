``ImSwitch`` is a software solution in Python that aims at generalizing microscope control by using an architecture based on the model-view-presenter (MVP) to provide a solution for flexible control of multiple microscope modalities. This here is a changed version for Descspim development.

## Installation

Install with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` and start it using ``python -m imswitch``. Also install the thorlabs SDK with ``pip install -e ./thorlabs_tsi_sdk-0.0.8/``.

## Documentation

Further documentation is available at [imswitch.readthedocs.io](https://imswitch.readthedocs.io).

## Testing

ImSwitch has automated testing through GitHub Actions, including UI and unit tests. It is also possible to manually inspect and test the software without any device since it contains mockers that are automatically initialized if the instrumentation specified in the config file is not detected.
